# Description
Banks are experiencing customer attrition while Churn analysis can be performed with relevant personal information, assets, and financial management data of customers. In data mining and artificial intelligence fields, the unique patterns of customer information can be learned and modeled using algorithms. Based on the Bank customer churn prediction dataset, several machine learning algorithms are employed, such as logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, support vector machine, KMeans, RandomForest, and XGBoost for model construction aiming at predicting churn accounts. The highest AUC (Area under curve) of ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) is achieved in model evaluation by adopting data processing and modeling techniques, including data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation, outlier removal, data normalization, feature selection, cross-validation, and class-weight balancing. The evaluation indicates that the fine-tuned neural network model outperforms others in terms of AUC, Recall, and F1 score achieving similar performance compared to XGBoost.
